These files are for easily generating QR Codes in html pages.

The .css is only needed for the "ib" class which puts it in a pretty inline block for easier display with other content.
qrjen.js does most of the work and has all the colors etc in there as Hex Colors.
testqr.html is just to try it out and demo a few different ways to use it.
